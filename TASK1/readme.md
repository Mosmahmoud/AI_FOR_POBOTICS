 I was working on finding the parameters of the linear regression equation 
 but, unfortunately it was different as :
   >>-in "from scratch code" : it was [[-8.71192991e+21 -3.70307663e+23 -4.39600360e+21 -2.72307555e+23 -9.65495210e+21 -6.94714315e+21 -1.35457062e+22]]
   >>-in "using sklearn" : it was [,258.78384176244134,-5.872384361831706,295.8478227772521,458.5002975725725,24046.107811144528,-354.3643406764811]
which it was very different
